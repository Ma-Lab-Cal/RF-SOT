# RF-SOT
Code and data for "Coherent spin wave generation with radio-frequency spin-orbit torque in a magnetic insulator"

Figure data are pickled python dictionaries in the figureData .zip. There is one .txt for each figure, excluding the first figure since that one is pure art. The simulation code is a .ipynb which is provided in its raw state more as an example than as something I expect people to be able to use. There will be a lot of re-pointing directories if you want to actually run it. mangum.np is necessary to run the script.
